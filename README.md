# OpenSeaCharts Style

You can use the style directly with the following url if your map viewer
supports PMTiles.

```url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSeaCharts/osc-style/refs/heads/main/openseacharts.json
```

It is possible to edit the style
on a [Maputnik instance with PMTiles supports](https://editor.protomaps.com/).
