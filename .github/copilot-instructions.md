# Copilot Instructions

- Keep `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` always up to date.
- When modifying sprite generation, update `sprites/generate_sprites.py`.
- `openseacharts.json` should be compatible with the vector tiles config from `OpenSeaCharts/osc-tiles`.
- Ensure GitHub Workflows are maintained for sprite generation checks.
